# PyCity School Analysis

## Project Overview
This analysis is performed on behalf of PyCity School Board (the "School Board", or "You").  The objective of this analysis is to provide summary level information on student academic performance in 15 high schools in PyCity.  Additional analyses are performed to present student performance by per-student spending, school size, and school type.  The School Board has indicated that evidence of academic dishonesty is present for math and reading scores of 9th grade students at Thomas High School.  As such, math and reading scores for this population has been removed from this analysis.

We have previously provided You with the same analysis inclusive of 9th grade math and reading scores at Thomas High School.  You have requested that we provide a summary of changes in our analysis resulting from the exclusion of this population.

## Results
- Changes to the District Summary table:
  - % Passing Math decreased from 75.0% per our prior analysis to 74.8%.
  - % Passing Reading decreased from 85.8% per our prior analysis to 85.7%.
  - % Overall Passing decreased from 65.2% per our prior analysis to 64.9%.
- In the Per School Summary table, the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing values have been updated to reflect only students in 10th - 12th grades.  Please note that School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, and Per Student Budget values remain unchanged.
- Thomas High School remains the second top performing school in the updated analysis.
- Average math and reading scores for Thomas High School now reflects "nan" as the underlying data has been excluded from this analysis.
- Scores by School Spending, School Size, and School Type remain unchanged, as the students excluded from the analysis (461 students) did not significantly impact the overall district level metrics.

## Summary
1. Math and reading scores for 9th grade students at Thomas High School has been excluded from this analys.  This exclusion removes 461 students.
2. As a result, average 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School now shows "nan".
3. As noted above, Thomas High School presents decreased passing rate for math and reading, as well as its overall pass rate.
4. Thomas High School remains as the second top performing school. Please note that Thomas High School showed higher reading pass rate compared to Cabrera High School in our prior analysis.  This has been reverted in the updated analysis.
